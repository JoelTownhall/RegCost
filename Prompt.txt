# Project: Measure Australian Federal Regulatory Burden Stock

## Objective
Build a Python tool to measure the current stock of regulatory burden in Australian federal regulations using two methodologies:
1. **BC-style Requirements Counting** - Simple counting of binding obligation words
2. **RegData-style Restrictions Counting** - Using QuantGov library approach

Output a one-page PDF report comparing both methodologies with a bar chart visualization.

## Background Context

### British Columbia Methodology
BC counts "regulatory requirements" as any action or step that must be taken under legislation, regulation, or policy. Their approach:
- **Count these binding words:** "must", "shall", "required"
- **Counting rules:**
  - Each distinct action/information requirement = 1 count
  - Multiple requirements in one provision = count each separately
  - Options (person must do A OR B) = 1 count (only one needed)
  - Conditional requirements (if you choose X, then must do Y) = count the "must"
  - Do NOT count: "may" (discretionary), qualifiers (e.g., "in writing"), prohibitions ("must not"), duplications
- **On forms:** Count complete pieces of information (e.g., "full name" = 1, not separate first/last)

### RegData/QuantGov Methodology  
Mercatus Center's approach counts regulatory "restrictions":
- **Count these words:** "shall", "must", "may not", "required", "prohibited"
- Uses natural language processing
- Can map restrictions to industries using machine learning
- Available as Python package: `quantgov`

## Data Source
Australian federal legislation is available at: https://www.legislation.gov.au/

Focus on:
- **Current in-force regulations** under the "Browse" section
- Start with Federal Register of Legislation database
- Prioritize regulations over primary legislation for initial scope
- Extract text from current consolidated versions

## Technical Requirements

### Part 1: Data Collection
1. Scrape or download current Australian federal regulations from legislation.gov.au
   - Focus on principal regulations (not amendments)
   - Get consolidated current text
   - Store locally in structured format (e.g., JSON or database)
   - Include metadata: regulation name, year, administering agency

2. Handle different document formats:
   - HTML (most common on site)
   - PDF (if necessary, use text extraction)
   - Consider rate limiting and respectful scraping

### Part 2: BC-Style Counting Implementation
Create a function that:
1. Counts instances of "must", "shall", "required" (case-insensitive)
2. Implements exclusion rules:
   - Exclude "must not" / "shall not" (prohibitions)
   - Exclude "may" contexts (discretionary)
   - Handle duplications (same requirement repeated)
3. Returns:
   - Total requirement count
   - Count by regulation
   - Count by administering agency (if metadata available)

### Part 3: RegData-Style Counting Implementation
1. Install and use `quantgov` library: `pip install quantgov`
2. Alternatively, implement simple restriction counter:
   - Count: "shall", "must", "may not", "required", "prohibited"
   - Case-insensitive matching
3. Returns:
   - Total restriction count
   - Count by regulation
   - Count by administering agency

### Part 4: Generate One-Page Report
Create a professional PDF report containing:

**Report Structure:**
1. **Header Section:**
   - Title: "Australian Federal Regulatory Burden Stock Assessment"
   - Date of analysis
   - Data source and scope

2. **Summary Statistics Box:**
   - Total regulations analyzed
   - BC Method Total Requirements
   - RegData Method Total Restrictions
   - Percentage difference between methods

3. **Bar Chart Comparison:**
   - Side-by-side bars comparing BC vs RegData totals
   - Clear labels and legend
   - Professional styling

4. **Methodology Notes (Brief):**
   - 2-3 sentences explaining each method
   - Note on what each metric represents

5. **Top 10 Most Burdensome Regulations:**
   - Table showing regulation name and count (using BC method)
   - Or by agency if that's more meaningful

**Technical specs for PDF:**
- Use `matplotlib` for bar chart
- Use `reportlab` or `fpdf` for PDF generation
- Single page, professional layout
- Include page border or header/footer

## Code Structure Suggestions

```python
# Suggested file structure:
# main.py - orchestrates the analysis
# scraper.py - handles data collection from legislation.gov.au  
# bc_counter.py - implements BC methodology
# regdata_counter.py - implements RegData methodology
# report_generator.py - creates PDF report
# config.py - configuration variables
```

## Deliverables
1. Python scripts implementing both methodologies
2. Data file(s) containing scraped regulations
3. One-page PDF report with comparison
4. README with:
   - How to run the code
   - Dependencies
   - Interpretation of results
   - Known limitations

## Important Considerations

### Scope Management
- Start with a **manageable subset** if full federal regulations are too large
  - E.g., regulations from 3-5 major departments
  - Or regulations containing "business" or "company" in the title
- Document the scope clearly in the report

### Data Quality
- Note any regulations that couldn't be processed
- Handle encoding issues gracefully
- Log errors to separate file

### Methodology Fidelity
- BC method: The simple counting approach is intentional - don't over-complicate
- RegData method: If `quantgov` library is complex, a simple word count of the 5 terms is acceptable for this initial analysis
- Document any deviations from official methodologies

### Performance
- If processing is slow, implement progress bars
- Consider caching scraped data
- Parallelize where appropriate

## Expected Differences Between Methods
The two methods WILL produce different numbers because:
- RegData includes "may not" and "prohibited" (prohibitions), BC excludes these
- BC excludes qualifiers more strictly
- BC has more nuanced rules for options and conditional requirements

The report should note this is expected and both metrics are valid measures of different aspects of regulatory burden.

## Validation
Manually verify counts on 2-3 sample regulations to ensure:
- Counts are in reasonable range
- Major patterns make sense
- No obvious bugs in counting logic

## Output Example
The final report might show something like:
- **Total Regulations Analyzed:** 450
- **BC Requirements Count:** 125,000
- **RegData Restrictions Count:** 140,000  
- **Difference:** +12% (RegData counts more due to including prohibitions)

---

## Getting Started
1. Explore legislation.gov.au structure and identify best scraping approach
2. Build data collection pipeline first
3. Test counting methods on small sample
4. Generate report with sample data
5. Scale to full dataset
6. Refine report formatting

Please implement this analysis, documenting your approach and any challenges encountered. Focus on producing accurate counts and a clear, professional report rather than perfect coverage of every regulation.
