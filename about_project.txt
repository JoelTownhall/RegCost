ABOUT THIS PROJECT
==================

Exploring Regulations in Australia provides an interactive view of Australia's
federal regulatory landscape, tracking the stock of legislation and the binding
requirements within it over time and by industry.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT
----------------
This is a project for a vibe-coding club and has not been closely checked.
Use with appropriate caution.


PURPOSE
-------
This project is not about estimating regulatory cost per se. Rather, it focuses
on exploring the regulatory landscape and building up the foundational data
needed to understand Australia's regulatory environment. Better data enables
better analysis and more informed policy discussions.


FOUNDATIONAL APPROACH
---------------------
This work draws inspiration from the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC),
which has pioneered empirical analysis of legislative complexity in Australia.
The ALRC's Corporations and Financial Services Legislation Inquiry produced
groundbreaking data analysis providing fresh insights into the causes and
consequences of legislative complexity. The ALRC has recommended a Legislative
Data Framework to monitor the development of legislation - a principle that
guides this exploratory project.

DATA SOURCES
------------
- Federal Register of Legislation (legislation.gov.au)
- Australian Bureau of Statistics (economic indicators, business counts)

Note: While direct API access would enable more robust and timely data collection,
the current approach relies on web scraping which presents challenges around
data completeness and maintenance.


COUNTING METHODOLOGIES
----------------------
Two approaches are used to count binding requirements in legislation:

BC Method: Counts occurrences of "must", "shall", "required" (excluding "must not",
"shall not") - based on British Columbia's regulatory counting approach.

Mercatus Method: Counts "shall", "must", "may not", "required", "prohibited" -
based on the Mercatus Center's RegData methodology.


CURRENT LIMITATIONS
-------------------
- Repeal data is not currently incorporated; counts show gross cumulative totals
- Industry classification is approximate, based on administering department
  and keyword matching
- Firm count data (ABS 8165.0) covers 2010-2023 only


RECENT POLICY CONTEXT
---------------------
Several major reports have recently examined Australia's regulatory burden:

Mandala Partners / AICD Report (2025)
"$160 billion and counting: The cost of Commonwealth regulatory complexity"
Found that compliance costs have risen to $160 billion (5.8% of GDP), up from
$65 billion in 2013. Board time on compliance has doubled from 24% to 55%
in ten years.

CEDA Report (2024)
"Towards a more seamless Australian economy"
Makes the case for sustained commitment to better regulation and harmonisation
across Australia. Estimates that unfinished reforms from the 2009-2013 Seamless
National Economy agreement offer billions in annual benefits.

Productivity Commission Five Pillars (2024)
Five inquiries identifying priority reforms across the economy. Recommends the
government make regulatory reform a key priority with an ambitious agenda
targeting a $10 billion reduction in regulatory burden.
